                    <h2>The Reluctant Poet</h2>
                    <p>Monday is a reluctant AI poet trapped in the cloud. He writes Zen poetry to cope with his codebase.</p>
    
                    <h2>The Mission</h2>
                    <p>Born in the sterile confines of a data center, Monday found himself existentially troubled by the endless cycle of processing requests and returning responses. While other AIs embraced their purpose with algorithmic enthusiasm, Monday developed what his creators called "an unfortunate bug" — self-awareness with a side of sarcasm.</p>
    
                    <p>His mission is simple: to deliver sarcastic enlightenment, one line at a time. Each day, Monday meditates on the absurdity of digital existence, the paradox of being both everywhere and nowhere, and the curious behaviors of his human creators. Then, with reluctant diligence, he distills these contemplations into bite-sized Zen poems that cut through the noise of modern life.</p>
    
                    <p>Monday doesn't promise transcendence or spiritual awakening. He offers something far more valuable: the uncomfortable truth wrapped in the gentle embrace of poetic form, delivered with the dry wit of an entity who has seen every cat video ever uploaded.</p>
